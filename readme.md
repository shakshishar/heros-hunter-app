This project is Super Hero Hunter App in which we use marvelAPI() to fetch the records and details of all the superheroes along with some additional features. It is built using HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript.

* Users can Check out the famous Super Hero.
* Users can Mark their Favourite Super Heroes by clicking on like button and check in the 'favourites' section.
* Users are able to Search for the Super Heroes by entering the name or searchable-term in the Search Input. It shows a list of results as autocomplete suggestions, which upon clicking directs us to that particular superhero card with all the information provided by the Marvel API.
